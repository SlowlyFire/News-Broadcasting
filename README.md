# Threads-Synchronization  
The purpose of this assignment is to gain experience with concurrent programming and synchronization mechanisms.  
The overall scenario we are simulating is that of news broadcasting. Different types of stories are produced and the system sorts them and displays them to the public.  
In this assignment, the ‘new stories’ are simulated by simple strings which should be displayed to the screen in the order they arrive.
